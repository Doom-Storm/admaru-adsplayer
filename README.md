## IMA Plugin Ad Events
The IMA Plugin fires events that can be listened for. Ad lifecycle events can be listened for by following our [Advanced Example](https://github.com/googleads/videojs-ima/blob/main/examples/advanced/ads.js). Other events are emited from the videojs player. Please see the below example to set up listeners for these events.

```javascript
this.player = videojs('content_video');

this.player.on('ads-manager', function(response){
  var adsManager = response.adsManager;
  // Your code in response to the `ads-manager` event.
})
```

Below are the events added by the videojs-ima plugin to the videojs player.

| Event | Event String | Payload |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Ad Started | 'ads-ad-started' | none |
| Ads Manager | 'ads-manager' | [google.ima.AdsManager](//developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/reference/js/google.ima.AdsManager) |
| Ads Loader | 'ads-loader' | [google.ima.AdsLoader](//developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/reference/js/google.ima.AdsLoader) |
| Ads Request | 'ads-request' | [google.ima.AdsRequest](//developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/reference/js/google.ima.AdsRequest) |

## Disable automatic ad break playback
In some circumstances you may want to prevent the SDK from playing ad breaks
until you're ready for them. In this scenario, you can disable automatic
playback of ad breaks in favor of letting the SDK know when you're ready for an
ad break to play. To do so:

1. Set ```autoPlayAdBreaks``` to false in the initial options.
2. Provide an ad break ready listener via ```setAdBreakReadyListener```.
3. Call ```player.ima.playAdBreak()``` in your ad break ready listener when
   you're ready to play the ads.

## Where do I report issues?
Please report issues on the [issues page](../../issues).

## Terms of Service
The IMA SDK plugin for Admaru video player uses the IMA SDK, and as such is subject to the
[IMA SDK Terms of Service](//developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/terms).
